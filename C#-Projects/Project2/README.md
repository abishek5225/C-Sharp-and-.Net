This is a simple C# console-based game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. It's fun, interactive, and helps you learn fundamental programming concepts.


->How the Game Works
    The program shows a menu with three options: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

    ->You select your move by entering a number (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors).
    ->The computer randomly selects its move.
    ->The program compares the moves to determine the winner:
        ->Rock beats Scissors.
        ->Paper beats Rock.
        ->Scissors beat Paper.
        ->Same moves result in a tie.
    ->A scoreboard keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.
    ->You can play as many rounds as you want or quit anytime.

What you can learn from this project:

Loops:
    The game repeats until the player decides to quit.

Conditionals:
    Used to compare player and computer choices to determine    the winner.

Random Number Generation:
    Learn how to generate random choices using the Random  class in C#.

Arrays:
    Store the options (Rock, Paper, Scissors) in an array for   easy access.
